# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

CNN: type of neural network used for image classification, recognition, etc.

# Model Explanation

### Multi-class Image Classifiation using CNN

###### * This model is made to classify defects of different types (in this case, 4) of a company's product. Due to confidentiality, the dataset cannot be revealed. 

* Training set: 70985, validation set : 7888 (total : 78873)
* Test set: 938
* Input shape: (200, 200, 3)
* Conv2D: 4 layers
* Optimizer: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
* Loss: categorical crossentropy
* Learning rate: exponential decay

###### note: model still in progress
